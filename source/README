To compile the source, call mvn (Maven http://maven.apache.org/) in the root source directory (builds everything) or in one of the subprojects (build just the subproject).

It is strongly recommended to use Java 1.6.0 or higher whenever possible, since repainting speed is much higher.

Have fun! Beer and comments to acardona at ini phys ethz ch
